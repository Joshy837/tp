### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** above explains the high-level design of PoochPlanner.

Below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of PoochPlanner.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of PoochPlanner in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `/delete ; name : Poochie`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="750" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than a concrete class. This is to prevent the coupling of a component to outside components, as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that comprises of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class, which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.
Note that `HelpWindow` refers to a window that provides general help for all commands. `HelpOtherWindow` refers to a window which offers help for specific commands.
The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data, so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to `Logic` component, because `UI` relies on `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("/delete ; name : Poochie")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `/delete ; name : Poochie` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

The `Logic` component:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`). `XYZCommandParser` uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />


The `Model` component:

* stores different states of address book inside versioned address book.
* stores the address book data (i.e., all `Person` objects are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (because the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="6000" />

The `Storage` component:

* saves both address book data and user preference data in JSON forma, which is read during the bootup of PoochPlanner.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add feature

#### Overview

The add-XYZ command enables users to add a new contact to PoochPlanner.

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PoochPlanner for the execution of the `add-person` command.

![Add Sequence Diagram](images/AddCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
**Note:** The implementation for person, staff, suppliers, maintainers are similar and only differ in the accepted attributes. `XYZ` can refer to `person`, `staff`, `suppliers`, `maintainers`. 
</div>

#### Details

1. The user inputs the command to add a new contact.
2. `AddCommandParser` parses the user input.
3. An `AddCommand` object is created.
4. The `AddCommandParser` returns the `AddCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `AddCommand`.
6. The `execute` method of `AddCommand` invokes the `addPerson` method in `Model` property to create new contact with the new `Person` object.
7. The `execute` method of `AddCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Add` command.

#### Example Usage
1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/add-person ; name : John Doe ; phone : 98765432 ; email : johnd@example.com ; address : 311, Clementi Ave 2, #02-25 `
3. The contact card for `John Doe` is created. This change should be reflected on the contact list page on PoochPlanner.

### Edit feature

#### Overview

The edit-XYZ command enables users to modify a specified field of an existing contact from PoochPlanner.

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PoochPlanner for the execution of the `edit-XYZ` command.

![Edit Sequence Diagram](images/EditCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

<div class="callout callout-important" markdown="span" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
**Note:** The implementation for person, staff, suppliers, maintainers are similar and only differ in the accepted attributes. `XYZ` can refer to `person`, `staff`, `suppliers`, `maintainers`. 
</div>

#### Details

1. The user inputs the command to edit a specified contact by first stating the target name of the contact they want to edit. This is followed by the respective fields and new values the user wants to modify.
2. `EditCommandParser` parses the user input and creates an `editPersonDescriptor` object which contains the new values to be edited for the specified contact.
3. An `EditCommand` object is created with the name of the contact to edit and the`editPersonDescriptor` object.
4. The `EditCommandParser` returns the `EditCommand` object.
5. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `EditCommand`.
6. The `execute` method of `EditCommand` finds the specified contact by `name`. The `execute` method then calls `createEditedPerson` of `EditCommand` which creates a new `Person` object that contains the updated values of the contact.
7. The `execute` method of `EditCommand` invokes the `setPerson` method in `Model` property to replace the specified contact with the new `Person` object.
8. The `execute` method of `EditCommand` invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method in `Model` property to update the view of PoochPlanner to show all contacts.
9. The `execute` method of `EditCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Edit` command.

#### Example Usage
1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/edit-person ; name : Alice Tan ; field : { phone : 9990520 ; email : impooch@gmail12.com }`
3. The contact card for `Alice Tan` is updated for the `phone` and `email` field respectively. This change should be reflected on the contact list page on PoochPlanner.

**Aspect: How to implement edit command in Persons class and subclasses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create 4 different edit command for the 4 contact types (Person, Staff, Maintainer, Supplier).
    * Pros: User friendly. Users will be less prone to error that involves trying to edit a field that does not exist for the specific contact type.
    * Cons: Steeper learning curve for the users due to the higher number of commands.

* **Alternative 2**: Combinng edit command into one edit command.
    * Pros: Much simpler suite of features for users, which makes it easier to start using.
    * Cons: Complex to implement due to the need to check the contact type at the point of parsing before splitting into the different separate edit commands to handle their edit separately. This will violate the abstract initial implementation of MVC as the model will have to be accessible at the parser class in order for the type checking to be done. 

### Delete feature

#### Overview

The delete command enables users to delete a specific contact from PoochPlanner.

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PoochPlanner for the
execution of the `delete` command.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="900" />

#### Details

**1**: The user inputs the command to delete a contact by stating the target name of the contact they want to delete.

**2**: `CommandParser` invokes the `parse` method which parses the user input by storing the prefixes and their
respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap` object.
**3**: A `DeleteCommand` object is created with the name of the contact to delete.

**4**: The `DeleteCommandParser` returns the `DeleteCommand` object.

**5**: The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `DeleteCommand`.

**6**: The `execute` method of `DeleteCommand` invokes the `deletePerson` method in the 'Model` property to remove the
specified contact from the `addressBook` property in `ModelManager`.

**7**: The `execute` method of `DeleteCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the
completion of the `Delete` command.

#### Example Usage

**1**: The user launches the application.

**2**: The user inputs `/delete ; name : Poochie` into the CLI.

**3**: The contact with the name ‘Poochie’ will be deleted from PoochPlanner.

**Aspect: How to implement delete command in Persons class and subclasses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Only accept the name field, where only the last name field will be taken.
  * Pros: User friendly. Users can easily correct the name field without deleting the previously incorrect name field entered. Since name cannot be edited, this ensures that the name will be consistent and the user do not have to check what to input everytime.
  * Cons: Less rigorous validation check on name as users may not intentionally enter a second name field.

* **Alternative 2**: Accept only one name field.
  * Pros: Less prone to possible errors due to stricter validation checks on name fields.
  * Cons: Less user friendly since users will have to put in more effort to fix their commands.

### Help feature

The help feature receive help for all commands.

#### Overview

The help command enables users to view help for all.

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PoochPlanner for the execution of the `help` command.

#### Details

1. The user inputs the command to view help for a specific command. This is followed by the command field specifying the command they want to view help for.
2. `HelpCommandParser` invokes the `parse` method which parses the user input by storing the prefix of its respective values as an `ArgumentMultimap` object.
   A `HelpCommand` object is created with the command type specified in the command field.
3. The `HelpCommandParser` returns the `HelpCommand` object.
4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `HelpCommand`.
5. The `execute` method of `HelpCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Help` command.

#### Example Usage

1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/help ; command : delete` into the CLI.
3. Help for the delete command will be displayed.

**Aspect: How to display different help command windows:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use only 1 help window to display help for specific commands. Difference
  in messages is created by displaying different strings.
  * Pros: Code is made much more concise.
  * Cons: Lengthy if-else statements are required to display the correct string.

* **Alternative 2**: Create a different window for each type of command.
  * Pros: All details relating to a single command is within its own page. Can be perceived as neater.
  * Cons: Highly repetitive code. Even small mistakes made, would have to be fixed in over 10 windows.

### Search feature

#### Overview

The `search` command enables users to find contacts in PoochPlanner that match the input search queries.

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PoochPlanner for the execution of the `search` command.

<img src="images/dg-images/search-command-sequence-diagram.png" width="900" />

#### Details

1. The user inputs the command to search for contacts with the specified search queries.
2. `SearchCommandParser`  invokes the `parse` method which parses the user input by storing the prefixes and their respective values in an `ArgumentMultimap` object, and using this object to create an instance of `KeywordPredicate`.
3. `SearchCommandParser` then creates a new instance of `SearchCommand` containing the aforementioned `KeywordPredicate`.
4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `SearchCommand`.
5. This invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method in `Model` property, taking in `KeywordPredicate` as a parameter to filter and update `UniquePersonList`.
6. The `execute` method of `SearchCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Search` command.

#### Example Usage

1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/search ; name : Poochie` into the CLI.
3. The address book is updated to display all contact cards that match the search queries.

**Aspect: How to implement search command using multiple field inputs:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Accepts multiple search fields as search query.
  * Pros: More user-friendly as users can conduct multi-layered filters using several fields at once, allowing for a more targeted search.
  * Cons: More prone to errors due to broader search scope over multiple fields.

* **Alternative 2**: Only accept 1 field as search query.
  * Pros: Less prone to errors due to stricter search only over 1 field.
  * Cons: Less user-friendly since users will not be able to conduct multi-layered filters using several fields at once.

### Sort feature

#### Overview

The `sort` command enables users to sort contacts in PoochPlanner by a target field.

The following sequence diagram models the interactions between the different components of PoochPlanner for the execution of the `sort` command.

<img src="images/dg-images/sort-command-sequence-diagram.png" width="900" />

#### Details

1. The user inputs the command to sort contacts with the target field.
2. `SortCommandParser` invokes the `parse` method which parses the user input through `ArgumentMultimap` and `mapName`, creating a new `Prefix` object.
3. `SortCommandParser` then creates a new `SortCommand` object with the target `prefix`, returning this object.
4. The `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `SortCommand`, which invokes the `updateSortedPersonList` method in `Model` property with the target `prefix` to update the interface of PoochPlanner to sort`UniquePersonList` by the target field.
5. The `execute` method of `SortCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Sort` command.

#### Example Usage

1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/sort ; field : phone` into the CLI.
3. The address book is updated to sort all the contact cards by ascending phone number.

**Aspect: How use sort command for ascending or descending order:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Sorts only by ascending order, alphabetically and numerically
  * Pros: Straight forward to key in command. Users can just key in the field they want to sort by without having to indicate whether to sort either is ascending or descending order.
  * Cons: Less flexible in sorting as later alphabets and larger values will take longer to find.

* **Alternative 2**: Sorts by both ascending and descending order depending on user indication
  * Pros: More flexible in sorting for users to sort in either way to find what they need.
  * Cons: Longer command, another field required to specify either ascending or descending sort.

### Note feature

#### Overview

The note command enables users to add notes to existing contacts in PoochPlanner.

4. `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `NoteCommand`. 
5. The `execute` method of `NoteCommand` invokes the `findByName` method in `Model` property to find the person with the specified name. 
6. The `execute` method of `NoteCommand` invokes the `setPerson` method in `Model` property to set the person in the existing contact list to the new `Person` object which has been edited the `execute` method of `NoteCommand`. 
7. The `execute` method of `NoteCommand` invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method in `Model` property to update the view of PoochPlanner to show all contacts. 
8. The `execute` method of `NoteCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Note` command.

#### Example Usage

1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/note ; name : Janna ; note : get kibble` into the CLI.
3. The given note will be added to the description of the contact with the given name.

**Aspect: How to store note field in Persons class and subclasses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Add note field to all 4 constructors (Person, Staff, Maintainer, Supplier).
    * Pros: Maintains OOP. As in real life, each person has a note description, having each class containing
  a note field models this and preserves OOP.
    * Cons: Changing the constructors of 4 classes is a tedious task.

* **Alternative 2**: Add note field to the Parent person constructor and use a setter to set new notes.
    * Pros: Much simpler implementation that will require less refactoring of code.
    * Cons: Violates OOP, specifically encapsulation as the other classes would be able to manipulate the
  inner details of the Person classes.

### Rate feature

#### Overview

The rate command enables users to rate a specific contact from PoochPlanner.

prefix in an `ArgumentMultimap`. A `RateCommand` object is created with the parsed name, and rating.

**3**: `LogicManager` invokes the `execute` method of `RateCommand`.

**4**: The `execute` method of `RateCommand` invokes the `findByName` method in `Model` property to find the
contact with the specified name.

**5**: The `execute` method of `RateCommand` invokes the `setPerson` method in `Model` property to set the contact
in the existing contact list to the new `Person` object which has been edited the `execute` method of `RateCommand`.

**6**: The `execute` method of `RateCommand` invokes the `updateFilteredPersonList` method in `Model` property to
update the view of PoochPlanner to show all contacts.

**7**: The `execute` method of `RateCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the
completion of the `Rate` command.

#### Example Usage

**1**: The user launches the PoochPlanner application.

**2**: The user inputs `/rate ; name : Poochie ; rating : 5` into the CLI.

**3**: The contact with the name `Poochie` is rated with rating 5.

**Aspect: How to store rate field in Persons class and subclasses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Add rate field to all 4 constructors (Person, Staff, Maintainer, Supplier).
  * Pros: Leverages inheritance, thus reducing repeated code and adheres to OOP.
  * Cons: Changing the constructors of 4 classes is a tedious task.

* **Alternative 2**: Add rate field to the Parent person constructor and use a setter to set new ratings.
  * Pros: Much simpler implementation that will require less refactoring of code.
  * Cons: Violates OOP, specifically encapsulation as the other classes would be able to manipulate the
    ratings of Person objects directly.

7. The `execute` method of `PinCommand`/`UnpinCommand` invokes the `setPerson` method in `Model` property to replace the specified contact with the new `Person` object. 
8. The `execute` method of `PinCommand`/`UnpinCommand` invokes the `updatePinnedPersonList` method in `Model` property to update the view of PoochPlanner to show all contacts. 
9. The `execute` method of `PinCommand`/`UnpinCommand` returns a `CommandResult` object which stores the data regarding the completion of the `Pin`/`Unpin` command.


#### Example Usage
1. The user launches the application.
2. The user inputs `/pin ; name : Alice Tan` or `unpin ; name : Alice Tan` into the CLI.
3. The contact card for `Alice Tan` is now pinned / unpinned. This change should be reflected on the contact list page on PoochPlanner.

**Aspect: How to implement pin/unpin command in Persons class and subclasses:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Only accept the name field, where only the last name field will be taken.
    * Pros: User-friendly. Users can easily correct the name field without deleting the previously incorrect name field entered. Since name cannot be edited, this ensures that the name will be consistent and the user do not have to check what to input everytime. 
    * Cons: Less rigorous validation check on name as users may not intentionally enter a second name field. 

* **Alternative 2**: Accept only one name field.
    * Pros: Less prone to possible errors due to stricter validation checks on name fields.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly since users will have to put in more effort to fix their commands. 

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `/delete ; name : Poochie` command to delete the Person named Poochie in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `/delete ; name : Poochie` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `/add-person ; name : John …​` to add a new person. The `/add-person` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `/list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `/list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `/clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `/add-person ; name : John...` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Design considerations:

#### Aspect: How undo & redo executes :

**Alternative 1 (current choice)** : Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

**Alternative 2** : Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
* Pros: Will use less memory(e.g. for delete, just save the person being deleted).
* Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Planned Enhancement**

1. Enhance command to be space insensitive
   1. Currently, we do not allow for incorrect spacings in commands. 
   2. ```/add-person ; name : Person1 ;phone :98883888;address:Pooch Street 32 ; email : impooch@gmail.com```.
   3. The above example will be considered as invalid since there is no spacing before the `phone` prefix and before the `address` prefix. The lack of spacing causes `phone` and `address` to not be parsed as valid prefixes.
   4. We plan to extend PoochPlanner to accept alternative possible inputs with incorrect spacings to cater to fast typists.

2. Enhance command to fix multiple white spacings in user's input
   1. Currently, we do not have any checker to verify if there exists multiple white spacings in user's input. 
   2. We take any input values `John Doe` with multiple number of spacing as different inputs as it is.
   3. We plan to parse all the input to remove additional spacings to cater fast typists as additional spacings are likely occur due to typo.

3. Enhance price to allow for decimal places
   1. Currently, we do not allow decimal places for prices.
   2. We plan to allow decimal places for prices to allow for greater flexibility in recording prices.

4. Enhance salary to allow for storage in different units
   1. Currently, we only allow storing salary with unit `/hr`.
   2. We plan to allow for more flexible storing unit such as `/day`, `/month` and `/event`.

5. Enhance validation on input fields for search command
   1. Currently, we do not have any validation on input fields such as salary, phone in search commands.
   2. If user insert random name in salary field, the execution will not throw any error.
   3. We plan to do validation check on all the fields to ensure that user is inserting correct type of value in the field.

6. Enhance post-search status
   1. Currently, after a search command, the contact book will only display the filtered contacts list.
   2. After exucution of delete, pin, unpin, undo and redo will not return to main contacts list.
   3. We plan to enhance the commands by returning to main list after every execution of command.

7. Enhance commission to allow for decimal places
   1. Currently, we do not allow decimal places for commission.
   2. We plan to allow decimal places for commission to allow for greater flexibility in recording commission. 

8. Enhance commission to allow for storage in different units
   1. Currently, we only allow storing commission with unit `/hr`.
   2. We plan to allow for more flexible storing unit such as `/day`, `/month` and `/event`.

9. Enhance phone number storage
   1. Currently, we only allow users to add one phone number to one contact.
   2. We plan to allow users to add more than one phone number to allow for greater flexibility in storing contacts.

### Appendix : Effort
#### Project Overview
Our project aimed to enhance the functionality of a contact management system, building upon the foundation laid by AB3 (Address Book 3). Key improvements included accommodating multiple types of contacts, refining command formats for user-friendliness, introducing dynamic search and sorting capabilities, implementing note and reminder features, integrating pin/unpin functionality, and incorporating undo/redo functionality. These enhancements aimed to provide users with a more intuitive and efficient contact management experience.

#### Difficulty Level and Challenges Faced
The project faced significant challenges due to its complexity and the need to seamlessly integrate new features with the existing AB3 framework. One major challenge was accommodating multiple types of contacts (staff, maintainer, supplier) while ensuring compatibility with the original AB3 data model and commands. This required thorough understanding of the project structure and meticulous modification of existing components, particularly the `JsonAdaptedPerson` classes.

Additionally, redesigning command formats and implementing new features such as dynamic search, sorting, note/reminder functionalities, and pin/unpin features demanded careful planning and detailed implementation. Adapting the undo/redo feature from AB4 to fit within the AB3 framework posed another challenge, as it necessitated significant modifications to the model manager and command execution flow while ensuring backward compatibility.

#### Effort Required
The effort required for the project was substantial, spanning analysis, design, development, testing, and documentation phases. The multidisciplinary team invested significant time and resources in understanding AB3's architecture, identifying areas for enhancement, and implementing new features while ensuring compatibility and stability. Agile methodologies were employed to iteratively address challenges and incorporate stakeholder feedback, resulting in an efficient development process.

#### Achievements
Despite the challenges, the project achieved several milestones that significantly enhanced the contact management system's functionality and user experience. Key achievements include:

1. Successful integration of multiple contact types, providing users with greater flexibility and organization capabilities.
2. Redesigning command formats for improved intuitiveness and ease of use, enhancing user interaction.
3. Implementation of dynamic search and sorting functionalities, empowering users to efficiently navigate and manage their contacts.
4. Introduction of note and reminder features, enabling users to add context and schedule tasks associated with contacts.
5. Seamless integration of pin/unpin functionality, allowing users to prioritize contacts.
6. Seamless integration of undo/redo functionality, allowing users to revert to previous states and improve data integrity.


#### Effort Saved Through Reuse:
Approximately 10% of the project effort was saved through strategic reuse of existing components and libraries. Notably, the redesign of command formats leveraged insights from previous projects and industry best practices, streamlining development and ensuring consistency. Additionally, adapting the undo/redo feature from AB4 involved reusing core concepts and methodologies, significantly reducing implementation complexity and effort.

In summary, the project's successful implementation of advanced features within the AB3 framework demonstrates our team's proficiency in software development and problem-solving. Despite the inherent challenges, our strategic approach to reuse and adaptation resulted in a robust and feature-rich contact management system that meets the evolving needs of users.
