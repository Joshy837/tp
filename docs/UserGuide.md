  For example, the actual command that you may input can be `/add-staff ; name : Poochie`.

  e.g. if the command specifies `address : [address] ; phone : [phone]`, `phone : [phone] ; address : [address]` is also acceptable.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

    <medium>Above is an example of searching for a contact named "Tom":</medium>
    <br>
    <medium>Input: <code>/search ; name : Tom</code></medium>
    <br>
    <medium>Output: Finds all contacts that have "Tom" within their name from your contacts list.</medium>
    <br>
</div>

<br> 


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Constraints:**<br>

* Any valid fields, such as `name`, `phone`, `address`, `email`, `salary`, `employment`, `price`, `product`, `skill`, `commission`, `tag` or `note`, can be provided as a search field.<br>

* Multiple search fields may be provided.<br>

* Queries are case-insensitive but space-sensitive.<br>

* Duplicate entries for the same fields are not allowed. For instance, `/search ; name : Janna ; name : Poochie` is not allowed.<br>

For search queries regarding `salary`, `price` and `commission`:

If you would like to search for the exact `salary`/`price`/`commission`, you may follow this format:<br>
* For `salary` and `commission`: `$[Number]/hr`<br>
* For `price`: `$[Number]/[quantifier]`<br>. Examples of quantifiers are "bag, "gram", "litre" etc. 

If you would like to search for `salaries`/`prices`/`commissions` within a specified range instead, you may follow this format:<br>
* `$[Query digits]`<br>
* For instance, if you would like to search for all salaries within the range `$50-59/hr`, you may key in `/search ; salary : $5`, with `$5` as the search query. This displays all staff that are paid from `$50/hr` to `$59/hr`.
* Note that this query also searches for staff with salaries of exactly `$5/hr`, from `$500/hr` to `$599/hr` as well, and even in larger ranges too.<br>

Examples of valid search commands:
* `/search ; salary : $50/hr`
* `/search ; price : $50/bag`<br>

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tips:**<br>

* Notes added are intended to be short details!<br>
* To remove a note, specify in the note field `No note here`. **This note is case-sensitive**.<br>
* For your convenience, if you have accidentally made a typo, you may conveniently rectify your mistake by retyping the field and value in your command as only the latest field will be processed.<br>
* Refrain from using `;` in your note. The use of `;` makes the command difficult to parse as ";" is used as a delimiter. This may result in your note not being captured. 

</div>

### Loading Data from Another Computer

**Q**: How can I transfer my PoochPlanner contacts to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install PoochPlanner in your target computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous PoochPlanner home folder by copying the contents of the `poochplanner.json` file from your current computer and pasting it inside the `poochplanner.json` file of your target computer.

### Using PoochPlanner

**Q**: What are the available commands in PoochPlanner?<br>
**A**: Please refer to our [Command Summary](#command-summary) for the list of available commands.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection to use PoochPlanner?<br>
**A**: All of PoochPlanner’s functionality can be used offline! No internet connection is required.

**Q**: How do I save my data?<br>

**Q**: If I have a lot of contacts, is there a way for me to access my most frequently used contacts easily?<br>
**A**: Yes! You may wish to keep your most important contacts at the top of your contacts list. With our `pin` feature, PoochPlanner ensures that you are always to see them!<br><br>The syntax for the `pin` command is as follows:
```
/pin ; name : [name]
```

**Q**: How can I remove a contact's rating?<br>
**A**: In PoochPlanner, a `0` rating corresponds to a non-rating (no rating is provided). Therefore, to remove a contact's rating, simply give the target contact a rating of `0`.<br><br>The syntax for the `rate` command is as follows:
```
/rate ; name : [name] ; rating : [rating]
```

**Q**: Can I append a note to a contact when creating it?<br>
**A**: Yes you can! In fact, you may also rate a contact at its time of creation. Simply append the `; note :` prefix, and you should be on your way!<br><br>

```
/add-person ; name : Pooch ; phone : 98883888 ; address : Pooch Street 32 ; email : impooch@gmail.com ; rating : 3 ; note : Hello my name is Pooch!
```
